In 2019 I completed a PhD in Socio-Informatics at Stellenbosch University.

The research concerned our behaviour with technology (specifically multitasking) and how this behaviour relates to our capacities to maintain focus and concentrate on what we need to do to succeed in our endeavours.

The thesis, titled "Media Multitasking and Cognitive Control: Assessing the Feasibility of an Intervention Requiring the Self-regulation of Smartphone Use", can be accessed on [SunScholar](http://hdl.handle.net/10019.1/107323){:target="_blank"}.
