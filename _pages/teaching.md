This course provides students with an introductory course in computer programming and problem solving.

Students are exposed to fundamental concepts in programming such as data types, variables, input, output, flow control (including iteration and decision structures), modules and functions.

## HonsBCom Information Systems Management: 

*Research Theory* (2017, 2018)<br/>

This block aims to equip students to complete their Honours-level research projects. Emphasis is placed, simultaneously, on understanding fundamental components of the research cyle, as well as the essential tools and techniques for effectively conducting a research project.

*Data Analysis* (2019)<br/>

The focus of this block is to introduce students to data analysis techniques that can be used for statistical or other data tasks. This block covers programming in R, data cleaning, data shaping and manipulation as well as some exploratory data analysis and visualisation. 

*Enterprise Systems* (2017, 2018)<br/>

This block has two primary focus areas. The first is the examination of the notion of enterprise systems, their role in organisations, and the various socio-technical challenges that they present. The second focus area applies the above concepts and more specialised themes to the study of enterprise system selection in small to medium sized enterprises and the notion of fit between these orgaanisations and selected enterprise systems.
