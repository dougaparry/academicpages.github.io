I am an early career researcher in Socio Informatics with interests in Computational Social Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Cyberpsychology. My research concerns the interplay between digital technologies, human cognition, behaviour, performance, and affective well-being across a variety of life-situations.

I hold a faculty position with the [Department of Information Science](http://suinformatics.com) at Stellenbosch University and am a member of the [Cognition and Technology Research Group (CTRG)](http://suinformatics.com/ctrg). I hold a bachelors degree majoring in Socio-Informatics and Economics, and Honours, Masters and Doctoral degrees in Socio-Informatics. 

Have any questions or want to collaborate? Feel free to [email](mailto:dougaparry@sun.ac.za) me or send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dougaparry). I am open to supervision of Master's or Doctoral research projects. If you are interested in working with me as part of the [CTRG](http://suinformatics.com/ctrg) please read [this document](https://dougaparry.com/files/supervision.pdf){:target="_blank"} on preparing an application for supervision.
