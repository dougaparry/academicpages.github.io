I am an early career researcher in Socio Informatics with interests in Computational Social Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Cyberpsychology. My research concerns the interplay between digital technologies, human cognition, behaviour, performance, and affective well-being across a variety of life-situations.

I hold a faculty position teaching and supervising within the undergraduate and postgraduate Socio Informatics programs as part of the [Department of Information Science](http://suinformatics.com) at Stellenbosch University. As a member of the [Cognition and Technology Research Group (CTRG)](http://suinformatics.com/ctrg), I am involved in a number of research projects concerning the interplay between digital technologies, human cognition and affective wellbeing. My research interests include: media effects, human computer interaction, and cyberpsychology. I hold a bachelors degree majoring in Socio-Informatics and Economics, Honours and Masters degrees in Socio-Informatics and am currently working towards a doctoral degree (PhD in Socio Informatics) specifically focusing on media multitasking and cognitive control.

Over my short academic career I have conducted a number of research projects, including: developing and testing map-based displays for time and location sensitive data; researching students' behaviour and beliefs associated with media while learning; comparing experts, crowd-sourced and machine-learning based predictions of sporting results; investigating cognitive effects associated with media multitasking; developing behaviour change interventions targeting media multitasking; as well as considering scientometric patterns in research profiles. The common thread across these projects rests on an interest in understanding how people use technology, how this use is shaped by personal, situational and societal factors and, in addition, how behaviour with technology shapes our lives.

Recently, I have developed an interest in understanding the future of work and how, at both an individual and societal level, digital technologies are shaping how people live and work. I am interested in applying computational research techniques to investigate changing patterns of skill-demand and the economic, social and cognitive effects of the gig-economy and labour automation. 

Additionally, I aim to extend my current research interests into behavioural motivations for and effects of personal use of digital technologies to consider interfaces between such behaviour and the changing world of work. I aim to use experimental methodologies, qualitative approaches as well as data-driven analyses to investigate how use of digital media in the workplace is shaping relationships, affecting performance, and changing how the notion of work is framed in society.
